#Looking for a simple website for free? It's time you tried Netlify

If you're looking for a simple website for your company, then you should look at Netlify.

With a website hosted on Netlify, you get 100GB per month bandwidth,  300 build minutes per month, 100 form submissions and more for free.

So, you can have a simple website like this one can without any ongoing costs.

You'll probably want to have your own domain name so grab one from Namecheap if you don't already have one and then just set it up in Netlify.

##Won't it be rubbish if it's free?

Modern websites are actually very good and those hosted with Netlify are fast.

As a user, can you tell that this website is being hosted for free?

Sure, if you exceed the limits then there is going to be a cost but for a small business that's unlikely to be the case any time soon.

##How does it work?

Choose your language - the templates which Netlify provide can help. This site has been built with NextJS

You'll host your code in GitHub and when you push out your changes, Netlify when build and deploy them for you.

##Will I get to choose what the site looks like?

Absolutely. With modern frameworks like Tailwind you can build responsive, stylish designs which are fast and adaptable.

##Is it something I can do myself?

If you have experience of building websites with modern frameworks such as React then absolutely you can.

Maintaining the site can probably be done with a CMS of some sorts such as Contentful.

But this site just uses Markdown - edit the content and push to GitHub - Bob's your uncle
